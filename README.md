Over the 52 minutes lecture of Harvard-CS50W Bryan taught me 13 lines of git commands. Which is I think pretty enough for any developer except DevOps engineers. I thought it might be helpful for beginners. Here are the summery: 

### copy github repository to your pc: git clone repo_url
### add file to git after changes: git add file_name
### finalize the changes: git commit -m 'message'
### send to github: git push 
### check the change status: git status 
### get latest code from github: git pull 
### when conflict happens: edit the codes by your own and commit it
### check all commits: git log 
### revert to previous working commit: git reset --hard commit_hash_code
### create new branch: git checkout -b branch_name
### delete a branch: git branch -d branch_name
### switch to branch: git checkout branch_name
### combine the branches: git merge branch_name
